            Welcome everyone. Today isn't about becoming a computer genius. It’s about learning a new rhythm.

              Ms. Julie had spent hours on the phone with three scammers posing as bank staff and police officers.

              Ms. Julie indicated that even though she'd subconsciously noticed red flags,

              There's no shame! We are all susceptible because we're all human. It's different

              Karen's story demonstrates how shame can keep you from getting the help you need.
            </p>

            <p>
              When talking about paperwork in Karen's case, it was noted, "since Karen was too
              embarrassed to tell anyone what she was involved in, she didn’t get a second opinion
              on the papers"

            <p>
              In Karen's story, she noticed that messages always came in at 2 AM.
              This was explained away, but it was a red flag (and she noticed!).
            </p>

            <p>
              It's just too bad she didn't collaborate with an advocate early on about
              this before establishing the relationship.
            </p>

            <aside class="notes">
              You're much more likely to be able to just cut a conversation or early relationship off
              without caring too much if it <em>is</em> early. That's why getting an Advocate
              <em>early</em> is so critical!

              Many scammers smartly make innocent requests and first and build trust.
              Some requests seem harmless (no cost).

            <p>
              However: beware of incrementalism. At first, requests may cost you nothing.
              Eventually, there may be small costs. Then more.
            </p>

            <aside class="notes">
              You've all hear the adage that putting a frog in a pan of cool water, then
              slowly heating it, will boil the frog (it'll never jump out). This may not
              be literally true in real life, but it is an apt metaphor for how sammers

            <p>
              This is an example of how modern scammers can use an AI model, trained on recordings of someone's voice, to
              mimic their manner of speech so well it can fool family members.

            <p>
              The fake granddaughter claimed she'd caused an accident and had been arrested and needed money to post bail.
            </p>

            <p>
              However, the call was soon "handed off" to another person, the supposed lawyer.

            <h2>Red Flag: The Handoff</h2>

            <p>
              Scams often involve having you interact with several different people. In the current example, it limited
              the opportunity for Jilll to notice that the AI voice didn't sound as much like her granddaughter as she
              initially supposed.

            <h2>Red Flag: The Handoff</h2>

            <p>A "handoff" may also be used for other purposes:</p>
            <ul>
              <li class="fragment">Lend Realism</li>
              <li class="fragment">Escalate Trust</li>

            </ul>

            <aside class="notes">
              It may make a scenario seem more "real" if you interact with more, clearly distinct people. Don't let this
              fool you. Scammers work in groups all the time.

              Also, a handoff may simulate moving from a party you're less inclined to trust, to a supposed authority
              figure (the police, for example) hoping you'll have less suspicion.

              We already talked about the "good cop, bad cop" effect earlier.

              We talked earlier: always be alert when money is involved. Most scammers are ultimately after this.
            </p>

            <p>
              This story combines money with the scammers trying to leverage embarrassment as a motive to prevent

              another number and a courier would come to their house and pick up the money. The

            <p>
              After you "Stop" your interaction and get an Advocate, a key technique is to reach back
              out to the party or organization that purportedly reached out to you: <em>not</em> using
              any contact information provided to you.

              etc. At a minimum, you may be able to use a password manager built into your main operating system
              (macOS, iOS, etc.).

              However, many people can't or won't set up and use a password manager.

              An alternative for these people: the classic "physical password manager", a notebook.

            <p>
              For a notebook to work, that means you can only "log in" to things when you're home.
              You need to have a secure place to keep it (a safe or other very secure/secret location)
              and be diligent in keeping it there.

            <p>
              You also need to be diligent in how you write down your passwords and update entries
              in your notebook. Crossing out old entries/lines and writing dates when you add entries
              is very helpful.

              Whatever you do, enable "Two-Factor Authentication" ("2FA" for short), or "Multi-Factor Authentication"
              ("MFA" for short) wherever you can. Typically, this may send one-time use codes to your phone (text or
              voice call) or email. This is in addition to entering your username and email.

              This could be an entire presentation by itself. Unfortunately, a lot of sites/devices enforce
              their own rules and there's always some site that'll make you have to "bend" whatever system
              you use.

              Specifically, for passwords you have to remember (can't write in a notebook or digital password
              manager) one technique is to use a "pass phrase" instead: a set of 3-4 random words that you
              memerize (and know how to spell). You decide whether they're all upper/lower case or capitalized
              and whether there's always a space, dash, or nothing between words.

            <p>
              Passphrases can be easier to remember than a long, random, complicated password while often
              being as, or more secure.

              The critical key for passwords, passphrase, PIN or other codes, is that they should be <em>random</em>!
              It may be easier for you to remember things based on facts about your life, but those are more easily
              guessed or cracked as well.

              Domain Names are part of the Domain Name System (DNS). These help us know how to access well-known
              websites. For instance, <em>google.com</em> is a "domain name".

            <h1>Domain Names: DNS</h1>

            <p>
              A domain name is used to find the true, underlying "IP Address" of a given website: the actual
              address of a computer on the internet.

            <h1>Domain Names: Hierarchy</h1>

            <p>
              Domain Names are like upside-down trees. There are roots and branches. But, being upside-down,
              the "roots" are referred to as the "top".
            </p>

            <p>
              A name with no dots is a "top-level" (or root) domain name. For example, <em>com</em>, <em>net</em>,
              <em>org</em> and <em>gov</em> are common US top-level names.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h1>Domain Names: Hierarchy</h1>

            <p>
              Top-level (or "root") domain names are never used directly on their own. There's always at least
              one more level (or branch) added. Different levels of the name are separated by dots: "."
            </p>

            <p>
              A "second-level domain" would be <em>google.com</em>. The "com" is the top-level. The second-level
              is "google". They're put together with a dot.

            <h1>Domain Names: Hierarchy</h1>

            <p>
              So, your read a domain-name from root (or "top") to leaf (or "bottom") going right-to-left.
            </p>

            <code>
              leaf.branch.trunk.us
            </code>

            <p>
              In the example above, this name as 4 levels. The top-level "domain" is "us". The next-level
              name is "trunk". Beneath that is "branch". The lowest level is "leaf".
            </p>
          </section>

            <h1>Domain Names: Hierarchy</h1>

            <p>
              Ownership and control of names follows the hierarchy.

            <code>
              leaf.branch.trunk.us
            </code>

            <p>
              The US government has authority over the "us" top-level domain name. They then
              delegate to some sub-organization for next-level names. Those organizations
              can in turn delegate control of lower-level names.

            <h1>Domain Names: Hierarchy</h1>

            <p>
              Many companies register a "dot com" through a "registrar" in order to get control
              of a name from the international organization that controls the "com" TLD.
            </p>

            <p>
              Then, within their own company, they may create "sub-domains" like "www" for "www.google.com"
              (www standing for "world wide web") or "gemini.google.com" where Google hosts their main AI
              tool Gemini's website.
